    CampaignSound campaignSound = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.Get(12345, "name,status,lengthInSeconds");

=== Download MP3 sound
'''
Download the MP3 version of the hosted file.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    MemoryStream ms = (MemoryStream)Client.CampaignSoundsApi.GetMp3(12345);
    File.WriteAllBytes("Resources/File-examples/train.mp3", ms.ToArray());

=== Download WAV sound
'''
Download the WAV version of the hosted file.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    MemoryStream ms = (MemoryStream)Client.CampaignSoundsApi.GetWav(12345);
    File.WriteAllBytes("Resources/File-examples/train.waw", ms.ToArray());

=== Add sound via call

 inside of the request, and the user will receive a call shortly after with instructions on how to record a
 sound over the phone.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    CallCreateSound callCreateSound = new CallCreateSound
    {
        Name = "call_in_sound_" + new DateTime().Millisecond,
        ToNumber = "12132212384"
    };
    ResourceId resourceId = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.RecordViaPhone(callCreateSound);
    Console.WriteLine("Sound id: " + resourceId.Id);

If you want to see created sound details please use code like:
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    CallCreateSound callCreateSound = new CallCreateSound
    {
        Name = "call_in_sound_" + new DateTime().Millisecond,
        ToNumber = "12132212384"
    };
    CampaignSound sound = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.RecordViaPhoneAndGetSoundDetails(callCreateSound, "id,name");

=== Add sound via text-to-speech
'''

 TextToSpeech.Message field, and pick a voice in the TextToSpeech.Voice field. Available voices are:

[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    TextToSpeech tts = new TextToSpeech { Message = "this is TTS message from csharp client" };
    ResourceId resourceId = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.CreateFromTts(tts);
    CampaignSound campaignSound = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.Get(resourceId.Id);
    Console.WriteLine("Campaign sound: " + campaignSound);

If you want to see created sound details please use code like:
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    TextToSpeech tts = new TextToSpeech { Message = "this is TTS message from csharp client" };
    CampaignSound sound = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.CreateFromTtsAndGetSoundDetails(tts, "id,name");

Upload mp3 or wav sound file.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    string mp3FilePath = "Resources/File-examples/train.mp3";
    CampaignSound mp3Resource = Client.CampaignSoundsApi.UploadAndGetSoundDetails(mp3FilePath, "fileName");
