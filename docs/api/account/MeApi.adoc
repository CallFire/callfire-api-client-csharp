= User account API

== Account specific APIs

=== Get account info
'''
Example how to get account information like name, surname, email, account permissions.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    UserAccount account = Client.MeApi.GetAccount();
    Console.WriteLine("Account: " + account);

=== Get billing plan usage info
'''
Example how to find billing plan usage for the user. Returns billing plan usage for the current month.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    BillingPlanUsage plan = Client.MeApi.GetBillingPlanUsage();
    Console.WriteLine("Plan: " + plan.ToString());

=== Get account caller IDs
'''
Example how to get a list of verified caller ids. If the number is not shown in the list, then it is not verified,
 and will have to send for a verification code.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    IList<CallerId> callerIds = Client.MeApi.GetCallerIds();
    Console.WriteLine("CallerIds: " + String.Join(",", callerIds));

=== Send verification code to caller ID
'''
Example how to send a verification code to the phone number. The verification code is delivered
 via a phone call. This code needs to be submitted to the verify caller id API endpoint.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    String phoneNumber = "12132224444";
    Client.MeApi.SendVerificationCode(phoneNumber);

=== Verify caller ID
'''
You can verify your caller ID with the verification code received from the previous operation, a call to this
 endpoint is required to finish verification.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    var request = new CallerIdVerificationRequest
    {
        CallerId = "12132212384",
        VerificationCode = "123"
    };
    bool? verified = Client.MeApi.VerifyCallerId(request);
    Console.WriteLine("Verified: " + verified);

== API credentials CRUD operations
*/me* endpoint has operations to *find, create, get and delete* API user credentials. To execute one of these
 operations you should create *CallfireClient* with your regular account credentials not API one, because only
 account holder can manipulate API users.

=== Create API credentials
'''
Example how to create API user.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    ApiCredentials credentials = new ApiCredentials { Name = "test1" };
    ApiCredentials created = Client.MeApi.CreateApiCredentials(credentials);
    Console.WriteLine(created);

=== Find API credentials
'''
Example how to get first 2 API users.
[source]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    var request = new CommonFindRequest { Limit = 2 };
    Page<ApiCredentials> apiCredentials = Client.MeApi.FindApiCredentials(request);
    Console.WriteLine("Page of credentials:" + apiCredentials);

=== Get API credentials
'''
Example how to get particular API user and limit returned fields to name and enabled flag.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    ApiCredentials credentials = Client.MeApi.GetApiCredentials(123456, "name,enabled");
    Console.WriteLine("Credentials:" + credentials);

=== Delete API credentials
'''
Example how to delete particular API user by ID.
[source,csharp]
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    Client.MeApi.DeleteApiCredentials(123456);
