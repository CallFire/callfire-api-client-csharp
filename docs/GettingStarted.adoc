= Getting started

== Installation

To install CallFire API v2 client, run the following command in the Package Manager Console
[source]
PM> Install-Package CallfireApiClient

or using nuget console tool:
[source]
$ nuget install CallfireApiClient

it will install the latest public version, other releases you can find at link:https://github.com/CallFire/callfire-api-client-csharp/releases[releases page].
After these steps *CallfireApiClient* should appear in your project dependencies along with other transitive ones.

* Note for Visual Studio installation: to be able to use api client please manually copy callfire-api-client.dll.config from your
solutionFolder\packages\CallfireApiClient.?.?.? folder to target dir.
You can use post-build event for that (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ke5z92ks.aspx).
Command example for post-build event:
[source]
xcopy "$(SolutionDir)packages\CallfireApiClient.?.?.?\lib\callfire-api-client.dll.config" "$(TargetDir)" /i /R /Y

In case you want to build it yourself:
[source]
    $ git clone https://github.com/CallFire/callfire-api-client-csharp.git
    $ cd callfire-api-client-csharp
    // build on windows platform
    $ gradlew.bat clean nugetPack
    // build on unix platforms
    $ ./gradlew clean nugetPack

it will produce zip & Nuget packages in *build/dist* directory:
[source]
    callfire-api-client.dll - client assembly
    callfire-api-client.dll.config - configuration file
    callfire-api-client.xml - XML documentation

then you can install Nuget package locally or unpack zip package into your project's lib directory.

== Overview
To create client instance just provide API login and password. API credentials should be configured on
link:https://www.callfire.com/ui/manage/access[Account -> Settings -> API Access] page. Client uses HTTPS connection
and Basic Authentication.

Example how to get account information using client:
[source,csharp]
    class MainClass
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
            Console.WriteLine(client.MeApi.GetAccount());
        }
    }

.*List of API groups:*
[source,csharp]
    var client = new CallfireClient("api_login", "api_password");
    client.MeApi;
    client.OrdersApi;
    client.BatchesApi;
    client.CampaignSoundsApi;
    client.MediaApi;
    client.ContactsApi;
    client.ContactListsApi;
    client.NumbersApi;
    client.NumberLeasesApi;
    client.KeywordsApi;
    client.KeywordLeasesApi;
    client.DncApi;
    client.DncListsApi;
    client.CallsApi;
    client.TextsApi;
    client.TextAutoRepliesApi;
    client.TextBroadcastsApi;
    client.CallBroadcastsApi;
    client.WebhooksApi;

== Error handling
The CallFire Developers API uses standard HTTP response codes for responses. These HTTP codes indicate whether
 or not an API operation is successful.

Status Code 200 is the desired response code. A standard JSON response will follow.

Codes in the 400s range detail all of the errors a CallFire Developer could encounter while using the API. Bad
 Request, Rate Limit Reached, and Unauthorized are some of the sorts of responses in the 400s block.

Codes in the 500s range are error responses from the CallFire system. If an error has occurred anywhere in the
 execution of a resource that was not due to user input, a 500 response will be returned with a corresponding
 JSON error body. In that body will contain a message detailing what went wrong.

.All API methods throw following exceptions:
 * *CallfireClientException* - in case error has occurred in client
 * *CallfireApiException* - in case API cannot be queried for some reason and server returned error (this is the base
 exception for API errors, some specific HTTP codes have their own exception):
 ** *400 - BadRequestException* - The request was formatted improperly
 ** *401 - UnauthorizedException* - API Key missing or invalid
 ** *403 - AccessForbiddenException* - Insufficient permissions
 ** *404 - ResourceNotFoundException* - The resource requested does not exist
 ** *500 - InternalServerErrorException* - We had an error! Sorry about that.
 ** other error codes will throw CallfireApiException

*CallfireApiException* has *ApiErrorMessage* property with details of occurred error, here is fields listing:
[source,csharp]
    int? HttpStatusCode;
    int? InternalCode;
    string Message;
    string DeveloperMessage;
    string HelpLink;

== Configuration
=== Proxy

Starting from version 1.1.4 users have possibility to make API calls go through proxy, here is an example how to configure it:
[source,java]
    RestApiClient.getClientConfig().Add(ClientConstants.PROXY_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, "localhost:3128");
    RestApiClient.getClientConfig().Add(ClientConstants.PROXY_CREDENTIALS_PROPERTY, "proxyuser:proxypass");
    // now create client
    CallfireClient Client = new CallfireClient("api_user", "api_pass");
    Console.WriteLine("account: " + Client.MeApi.GetAccount());

*IMPORTANT.* You must add proxy address property and proxy credentials (if needed) before client instantiation!

Proxy address port is optional, 8080 is used by default.

== Debug & logging
In case you want to see requests/responses which client sends/receives from Callfire platform you should copy
*system.diagnostics* section from callfire-api-client.dll.config into your application's app.config file, then
it will create callfire-api-client.log file in your work directory with debug output:
[source]
2015/10/21 19:02:47:355 EEST [DEBUG] RestApiClient - GET request to https://api.callfire.com/v2/me/account with params: []
2015/10/21 19:02:48:722 EEST [DEBUG] RestApiClient - received entity
{
  "id" : 1234567890,
  "email" : "john@callfire.com",
  "name" : "test",
  "firstName" : "John",
  "lastName" : "Doe",
  "permissions" : [ "ACCOUNT_HOLDER" ]
}

Source code debugging is available with a help of nuget symbolsource directory.
Recommended configuration for Visual Studio:

== Platform compatibility

Library was built and tested on OS X with mono 4.2.1 .NET 4.5 and Windows 7 x64 .NET 4.5 platform


== Troubleshooting
In case you have an issue, please create a ticket at link:https://github.com/CallFire/callfire-api-client-csharp/issues[Issues] page.
Issue description should contain a brief info (including versions) about platform, IDE, .NET framework where this SDK is used.

.What you should verify:
 * callfire-api-client.dll.config file is placed next to .dll assembly
 * System.Configuration is selected in project's references window
